Auto Scaling
    What is Autoscaling
    * If demand is high compare to the allocation, resources will be upgraded based on the scaling method 

2 types of Scaling (Auto)

* Horizontal Scaling
    Resources (servers) are added with the same capacity

    Scale Out - Adding more same capacity servers 
    Scale In - Removing/destroying machines from Auto scaling

    
* Vertical Scaling
    Capacity of existing servers (Hardware) will be upgraded 

    Scale UP - Increase the capacity of the Server
    Scale Down - Decreasing the capacity of the Server

    Requirement for Auto Scaling
        Templetes - AMI Images of the instances
        Metrics - Measurement of Scaling inputs
                * Avg CPU Utilization
                * Avg Network In (Measured in Bytes)
                * Avg Network Out(Measured in Bytes) 
                * Active Number of requests on Load Balancer per Target


        - Maximum Number of Instance - 200
        - Minimum Number of Instnace - 100
        - Desired Number of Instances  (Minimum Desired Capacity & Maximum Desired Capacity)


++++ Autoscaling - First need to create a Templete ++++++++

Types of Scaling
    - Manual Scaling
    - Dynamic Scaling 
    - Scheduled Scaling - Schedule a Auto scaling time based on need (Weekdays)
    - Predective Scaling - AWS is going to analyse work group, and decides its own Dynamic AutoScaling policy and applies 




    DELETION OF AUTO SCALING GROUP RESOURCES
        DONT DELETE INSTANCE DIRECTLY, INSTEAD DELETE PARTICULAR AUTO SCALING GROUP (It will delete all the resources that created as part of Auto Scaling)
